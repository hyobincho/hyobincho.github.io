I an Hyobin Cho, a senior-year student at the University of Pittsburgh studying Mathematics. It's been just more than a year since I have started my new academic journey in the United States. Before then, I served my country as an Air Force Cadet at the Korea Air Force Academy for about three years. With the passion and enthusiasm toward learning profound math and its application, I made this big transition in my life! My research interests lie in the mathematical aspects of medical image analysis and application of ML algorithms for medical image analysis.
